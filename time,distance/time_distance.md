# Time, Speed, and Distance

## Basic Concepts

- **Speed:** The distance covered per unit time. Formula: \(\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}}\)
- **Distance:** The total length of the path traveled. Formula: \(\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}\)
- **Time:** The duration taken to cover a distance. Formula: \(\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}\)

## Important Relationships

1. **If time is constant:** \(\text{Distance} \propto \text{Speed}\) (higher speed, more distance covered).
2. **If speed is constant:** \(\text{Distance} \propto \text{Time}\) (longer time, more distance covered).
3. **If distance is constant:** \(\text{Speed} \propto \frac{1}{\text{Time}}\) (higher speed, lesser time taken).

## Units and Conversions

- **Speed Units:** Kilometers per hour (km/h), Meters per second (m/s), Miles per hour (mph)
- **Conversion Formulas:**
  - \(1\) km/h = \(\frac{5}{18}\) m/s
  - \(1\) m/s = \(\frac{18}{5}\) km/h = \(3.6\) km/h
  - \(1\) mile = \(1.60934\) km
  - \(1\) yard = \(3\) feet
  - \(1\) mile = \(1760\) yards = \(5280\) feet
  - \(1\) hour = \(60\) minutes = \(3600\) seconds
  - \(1\) mph = \(\frac{22}{15}\) ft/s

## Formulas for Common Problems

1. **Average Speed:**
   - If a journey covers two equal distances at different speeds \(S_1\) and \(S_2\):
     - \(\text{Average Speed} = \frac{2 S_1 S_2}{S_1 + S_2}\)
   - If time taken is equal for two speeds:
     - \(\text{Average Speed} = \frac{S_1 + S_2}{2}\)

2. **Relative Speed:**
   - **Same direction:** \(\text{Relative Speed} = S_1 - S_2\)
   - **Opposite direction:** \(\text{Relative Speed} = S_1 + S_2\)
   - **Time taken when moving in opposite directions:** \(\text{Time} = \frac{L_1 + L_2}{S_1 + S_2}\)
   - **Time taken when moving in the same direction:** \(\text{Time} = \frac{L_1 + L_2}{S_1 - S_2}\)

3. **Train Problems:**
   - **Train passing an electric pole or a person:** \(\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Length of Train}}{\text{Time}}\)
   - **Two trains crossing each other:** \(S_1 + S_2 = \frac{L_1 + L_2}{t}\)
   - **Train crossing a stationary object (platform, tunnel):** \(\text{Time} = \frac{L_1 + L_2}{S}\)
   - **Train crossing a moving object (with length):**
     - **Opposite direction:** \(\text{Time} = \frac{L_1 + L_2}{S_1 + S_2}\)
     - **Same direction:** \(\text{Time} = \frac{L_1 + L_2}{S_1 - S_2}\)

4. **Boat and Stream:**
   - Speed in still water = \(\frac{\text{Upstream Speed} + \text{Downstream Speed}}{2}\)
   - Speed of stream = \(\frac{\text{Downstream Speed} - \text{Upstream Speed}}{2}\)

## Concept of Acceleration

- **Acceleration (a):** The rate of change of speed.
  - Formula: \(a = \frac{V - U}{t}\)
  - **Final Speed Formula:** \(V = U + at\)
  - **Distance Formula:** \(S = Ut + \frac{1}{2} a t^2\)
  - **Acceleration due to gravity:** \(g = 9.8 m/s^2\)

## Additional Key Concepts

- **Race Problems:** If A beats B by X meters in a race of D meters, then A’s speed to B’s speed is: \(\frac{D}{D - X}\)
- **Chasing Problems:** If A chases B with speeds \(S_A\) and \(S_B\), and the initial gap is D, then time to catch up = \(\frac{D}{S_A - S_B}\)
