# Time, Speed, and Distance

## Basic Concepts
- **Speed:** (Speed = Distance/Time)
- **Distance:** (Distance = Speed × Time)
- **Time:** (Time = Distance/Speed)

## Important Relationships
1. **If time is constant:** (Distance ∝ Speed)
2. **If speed is constant:** (Distance ∝ Time)
3. **If distance is constant:** (Speed ∝ 1/Time)

## Units and Conversions
- **Speed Units:** km/h, m/s, mph
- **Conversion Formulas:**
  - (1 km/h = 5/18 m/s)
  - (1 m/s = 18/5 km/h = 3.6 km/h)
  - (1 mile = 1.60934 km)
  - (1 yard = 3 feet)
  - (1 mile = 1760 yards = 5280 feet)
  - (1 hour = 60 minutes = 3600 seconds)
  - (1 mph = 22/15 ft/s)

## Formulas for Common Problems
1. **Average Speed:**
   - For two equal distances at different speeds (S1, S2): (Average Speed = 2 S1 S2 / (S1 + S2))
   - If time taken is equal for two speeds: (Average Speed = (S1 + S2)/2)

2. **Relative Speed:**
   - **Same direction:** (Relative Speed = S1 - S2)
   - **Opposite direction:** (Relative Speed = S1 + S2)
   - **Time (opposite directions):** (Time = (L1 + L2) / (S1 + S2))
   - **Time (same direction):** (Time = (L1 + L2) / (S1 - S2))

3. **Train Problems:**
   - **Passing an electric pole/person:** (Speed = Length of Train / Time)
   - **Two trains crossing each other:** (S1 + S2 = (L1 + L2)/t)
   - **Train crossing a stationary object:** (Time = (L1 + L2) / S)
   - **Train crossing a moving object:**
     - **Opposite direction:** (Time = (L1 + L2) / (S1 + S2))
     - **Same direction:** (Time = (L1 + L2) / (S1 - S2))

4. **Boat and Stream:**
   - (Speed in still water = (Upstream Speed + Downstream Speed)/2)
   - (Speed of stream = (Downstream Speed - Upstream Speed)/2)

## Concept of Acceleration
- **Acceleration (a):** (a = (V - U)/t)
- **Final Speed:** (V = U + at)
- **Distance Formula:** (S = Ut + (1/2) a t²)
- **Acceleration due to gravity:** (g = 9.8 m/s²)

## Additional Key Concepts
- **Race Problems:** If A beats B by X meters in a race of D meters, then (Speed of A / Speed of B = D / (D - X))
- **Chasing Problems:** If A chases B with speeds SA and SB, and the initial gap is D, then (Time to catch up = D / (SA - SB))
