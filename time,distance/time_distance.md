# Time, Speed, and Distance

## Basic Concepts

- **Speed:** The distance covered per unit time. Formula: Speed = Distance / Time
- **Distance:** The total length of the path traveled. Formula: Distance = Speed × Time
- **Time:** The duration taken to cover a distance. Formula: Time = Distance / Speed

## Important Relationships

1. **If time is constant:** Distance ∝ Speed (higher speed, more distance covered).
2. **If speed is constant:** Distance ∝ Time (longer time, more distance covered).
3. **If distance is constant:** Speed ∝ 1/Time (higher speed, lesser time taken).

## Units and Conversions

- **Speed Units:** Kilometers per hour (km/h), Meters per second (m/s), Miles per hour (mph)
- **Conversion Formulas:**
  - 1 km/h = (5/18) m/s
  - 1 m/s = (18/5) km/h = 3.6 km/h
  - 1 mile = 1.60934 km
  - 1 yard = 3 feet
  - 1 mile = 1760 yards = 5280 feet
  - 1 hour = 60 minutes = 3600 seconds
  - 1 mph = (22/15) ft/s

## Formulas for Common Problems

1. **Average Speed:**

   - If a journey covers two equal distances at different speeds \(S_1\) and \(S_2\):
     - Average Speed = \(\frac{2 S_1 S_2}{S_1 + S_2}\)
   - If time taken is equal for two speeds:
     - Average Speed = \(\frac{S_1 + S_2}{2}\)

2. **Relative Speed:**

   - **Same direction:** Relative Speed = \(S_1 - S_2\)
   - **Opposite direction:** Relative Speed = \(S_1 + S_2\)
   - **Time taken when moving in opposite directions:** Time = \(\frac{L_1 + L_2}{S_1 + S_2}\)
   - **Time taken when moving in the same direction:** Time = \(\frac{L_1 + L_2}{S_1 - S_2}\)

3. **Train Problems:**

   - **Train passing an electric pole or a person:** Speed = Length of Train / Time
   - **Two trains crossing each other:** \(S_1 + S_2 = \frac{L_1 + L_2}{t}\)
   - **Train crossing a stationary object (platform, tunnel):** Time = \(\frac{L_1 + L_2}{S}\)
   - **Train crossing a moving object (with length):**
     - **Opposite direction:** Time = \(\frac{L_1 + L_2}{S_1 + S_2}\)
     - **Same direction:** Time = \(\frac{L_1 + L_2}{S_1 - S_2}\)

4. **Boat and Stream:**

   - Speed in still water = (Upstream speed + Downstream speed) / 2
   - Speed of stream = (Downstream speed - Upstream speed) / 2

## Concept of Acceleration

- **Acceleration (a):** The rate of change of speed.
  - Formula: \(a = \frac{V - U}{t}\)
  - **Final Speed Formula:** \(V = U + at\)
  - **Distance Formula:** \(S = Ut + \frac{1}{2} a t^2\)
  - **Acceleration due to gravity:** \(g = 9.8 m/s^2\)

## Additional Key Concepts

- **Race Problems:** If A beats B by X meters in a race of D meters, then A’s speed to B’s speed is: Ratio = \(\frac{D}{D - X}\)
- **Chasing Problems:** If A chases B with speeds \(S_A\) and \(S_B\), and the initial gap is D, then time to catch up = \(\frac{D}{S_A - S_B}\)

## Examples

### Example 1

**Problem:** A train 120 meters long passes an electric pole in 12 seconds and another train of the same length traveling in the opposite direction in 8 seconds. Find the speed of the second train.

**Solution:**

- Speed of first train = 120 / 12 = **10 m/s**
- Speed of second train = (120 / 8) - 10 = **5 m/s**

### Example 2

**Problem:** Two trains moving in the same direction at speeds of 70 km/h and 90 km/h. The faster train crosses a man in the slower train in 36 sec. Find the length of the faster train.

**Solution:**

- Relative speed = 90 - 70 = **20 km/h** = (20 × 5/18) = **50/9 m/s**
- Length of faster train = (50/9) × 36 = **200 meters**

### Example 3

**Problem:** A train covers first half of the distance at 40 km/h and the remaining half at 60 km/h. Find the average speed.

**Solution:**

- Average speed = \(\frac{2 \times 40 \times 60}{40 + 60}\) = **48 km/h**

### Example 4

**Problem:** A car covers 8 km in the first quarter of an hour, 6 km in the second quarter, and 16 km in the third quarter. Find the average speed of the car.

**Solution:**

- Total distance = 8 + 6 + 16 = **30 km**
- Total time = **0.75 hours**
- Average speed = 30 / 0.75 = **40 km/h**

### Example 5

**Problem:** A tourist covers half the journey by train at 60 km/h, half the remainder by bus at 30 km/h, and the rest by cycle at 10 km/h. Find the average speed of the tourist.

**Solution:**

- Let total distance = 120 km
- Distance by train = 60 km, time = 60/60 = **1 hr**
- Distance by bus = 30 km, time = 30/30 = **1 hr**
- Distance by cycle = 30 km, time = 30/10 = **3 hr**
- Total time = 1 + 1 + 3 = **5 hr**
- Average speed = 120 / 5 = **24 km/h**
