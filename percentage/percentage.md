### **Percentage Notes (For Placements & Quick Understanding)**

## **1. Basics of Percentage**

### **Formula:**

- Percentage = (Value / Total Value) × 100
- A percentage is a fraction where the denominator is always 100.

**Example:** Find 25% of 200.
**Solution:** (25/100) × 200 = 50.

---

## **2. Percentage Increase/Decrease**

### **Formula:**

- **Increase:** New Value = Old Value × (1 + a/100)
- **Decrease:** New Value = Old Value × (1 - a/100)

**Example:** If price increases by 20%, how much should consumption decrease to keep expenditure the same?\
**Solution:** (20/120) × 100 = 16.67% decrease.

---

## **3. Population Formula**

### **Formula:**

- **Future Population (after n years):**\
  \(P = P_0 \times (1 + \frac{r}{100})^n\)
- **Past Population (before n years):**\
  \(P = P_0 \times (1 - \frac{r}{100})^n\)

**Example:** A town’s population is 10,000 and increases by 5% annually. Find the population after 2 years.\
**Solution:** 10000 × (1.05)^2 = 11025.

---

## **4. Successive Percentage Change**

### **Formula:**

- Net Change = x + y + (xy / 100)

**Example:** If a number increases by 10% and then decreases by 10%, what is the net effect?\
**Solution:** (10 × 10) / 100 = 1%. Net decrease = 1%.

---

## **5. Comparing Salaries & Incomes**

### **Formula:**

- If A’s income is x% more than B’s, then B’s income is **(x / (100 + x)) × 100%** less than A’s.

**Example:** A’s income is 10% more than B’s. Find how much % B’s income is less than A’s?\
**Solution:** Required Percentage = (10/110) × 100 = 9.09%.

---

## **6. Exam Marks Calculation**

### **Formula:**

- Total Marks = (Obtained Marks + Failed Marks) × 100 / Passing Percentage

**Example:** If **35% is passing marks**, a student gets **135 marks** and fails by **40 marks**, find total marks.\
**Solution:** (135 + 40) × 100 / 35 = 500 marks.

---

## **7. Performance Comparison**

### **Formula:**

- Performance = (Marks Obtained / Total Marks) × 100
- % Better Performance = (Higher % - Lower %)

**Example:** Rohit scored **480/600**, Mohit scored **560/800**. Who performed better?\
**Solution:**

- Rohit: (480/600) × 100 = 80%
- Mohit: (560/800) × 100 = 70%
- Rohit performed 10% better.

---

## **8. Election Votes Calculation**

### **Formula:**

- Total Votes = (Winning Margin / Difference in % Votes) × 100

**Example:** If the winner got 52%, the loser 48%, and the winning margin is 98 votes, find total votes.\
**Solution:** (98/4) × 100 = 2450 valid votes. Total votes = 2450 + 65 = 2515.

---

## **9. Area Change in a Rectangle**

### **Formula:**

- Net % Change in Area = x + y + (xy / 100)

**Example:** If **length increases by 30%** and **breadth by 20%**, find the % change in area.\
**Solution:** 30 + 20 + (30×20)/100 = 56%.

---

## **10. Percentage Error**

### **Formula:**

- Percentage Error = ((Actual Value - Incorrect Value) / Actual Value) × 100

**Example:** A number is mistakenly **divided by 10** instead of being **multiplied by 10**. Find % error.\
**Solution:** Error = ((100 - 1)/100) × 100 = 99%.

---

## **11. Finding the Original Fraction**

### **Formula:**

- (New Numerator / Old Numerator) = (New Denominator / Old Denominator)

**Example:** If numerator increases by 400% and denominator by 500%, and new fraction is 15/22, find original.\
**Solution:** Original fraction = 9/11.

---

## **12. Comparing Three Incomes**

### **Formula:**

- A’s income compared to C = (A - C) / C × 100

**Example:** A earns 40% more than B, B earns 20% less than C. Find % A earns more than C.\
**Solution:** A earns 12% more than C.

---

## **13. Expenditure Calculation**

### **Formula:**

- Expenditure Before = Expenditure After
- **Expenditure = Quantity × Price**

(For grocery price, assume **1 kg as quantity**.)

---

## **Example Set**

1. A number is increased by 20% and then decreased by 20%. Find the net percentage change.\
   **Solution:** 20 - 20 + (20×20)/100 = -4% (Net decrease)

2. A’s salary is 25% more than B’s. How much percent is B’s salary less than A’s?\
   **Solution:** (25/125) × 100 = 20%.

3. A sells a product at 20% profit. Find cost price if selling price is ₹120.\
   **Solution:** CP = 120 × 100 / 120 = ₹100.

4. The population of a city increases by 10% annually. Find population after 2 years if current population is 5000.\
   **Solution:** 5000 × (1.1)^2 = 6050.

5. A person spends 80% of his income. If his income increases by 25%, find the % increase in savings.\
   **Solution:** Savings increase by 125%.

6. If the price of an article is reduced by 20%, by how much should consumption increase to keep expenditure same?\
   **Solution:** (20 / (100 - 20)) × 100 = 25% increase.

7. A student secured 45% marks in an exam and failed by 20 marks. The pass percentage is 50%. Find total marks.\
   **Solution:** Total marks = (20 / (50 - 45)) × 100 = 400.

8. If the length of a rectangle is increased by 25% and breadth decreased by 20%, find % change in area.\
   **Solution:** 25 - 20 + (25 × -20)/100 = 0% (No change).
