### **Percentage Notes (For Placements & Quick Understanding)**

## **1. Basics of Percentage**

### **Formula:**

Percentage = (Value / Total Value) × 100

A percentage is a fraction where the denominator is always 100.

**Example:** A shopkeeper gives a 25% discount on a ₹200 item. Find the discounted price.

**Solution:**

1. Discount = (25/100) × 200 = ₹50
2. New Price = ₹200 - ₹50 = ₹150

## **2. Percentage Increase/Decrease**

### **Formula:**

**Increase:** New Value = Old Value × (1 + a/100)\
**Decrease:** New Value = Old Value × (1 - a/100)

**Example:** If the price of a commodity rises by 15%, how much should consumption decrease to keep expenditure the same?

**Solution:**

1. Let original expenditure be `E` and price per unit be `P`.
2. New price per unit = `P × 1.15`.
3. To maintain expenditure, new quantity = `E / (P × 1.15)`.
4. Percentage decrease in quantity = (15 / 115) × 100 = **13.04% decrease**.

## **3. Population Formula**

### **Formula:**

**Future Population (after n years):**\
P = P₀ × (1 + r/100)ⁿ\
**Past Population (before n years):**\
P = P₀ × (1 - r/100)ⁿ

**Example:** A city's population is 8,000 and grows by 8% annually. Find the population after 3 years.

**Solution:**

1. Given: Initial population = 8000, Growth rate = 8%, Time = 3 years.
2. Population after 3 years = 8000 × (1.08)^3.
3. \= 8000 × 1.2597 ≈ **10,078 people**.

## **4. Successive Percentage Change**

### **Formula:**

Net Change = x + y + (xy / 100)

**Example:** If a value first increases by 12% and then decreases by 8%, find the net percentage change.

**Solution:**

1. Applying formula: 12 - 8 + (12 × -8)/100.
2. \= 12 - 8 - 0.96 = **3.04% increase**.

---

## **5. Comparing Salaries & Incomes**

### **Formula:**

If A’s income is x% more than B’s, then B’s income is (x / (100 + x)) × 100% less than A’s.

**Example:** A’s income is 20% more than B’s. Find how much % B’s income is less than A’s.

**Solution:**

1. Using formula: (20/120) × 100.
2. \= **16.67% less**.

---

## **6. Exam Marks Calculation**

### **Formula:**

Total Marks= (Obtained Marks + Failed Marks) × 100 / Passing Percentage

**Example:** A student scores 150 marks and fails by 30 marks when the pass percentage is 40%. Find total marks.

**Solution:**

1. Using formula: (150 + 30) × 100 / 40.
2. \= **450 marks**.

---

## **7. Performance Comparison**

### **Formula:**

Performance = (Marks Obtained / Total Marks) × 100\
% Better Performance = (Higher % - Lower %)

**Example:** Aryan scores 540/750, and Nikhil scores 520/700. Who performed better?

**Solution:**

1. Aryan’s percentage = (540/750) × 100 = **72%**.
2. Nikhil’s percentage = (520/700) × 100 = **74.29%**.
3. Difference = 74.29 - 72 = **2.29% better**.

---

## **8. Election Votes Calculation**

### **Formula:**

Total Votes = (Winning Margin / Difference in % Votes) × 100

**Example:** In an election contested by two candidates, one candidate got 40% of total votes and yet lost by 1000 votes. Find the total number of votes cast.

**Solution:**

1. Let total votes be `V`.
2. Candidate 1 got 40% votes = `0.4V`, Candidate 2 got 60% votes = `0.6V`.
3. Difference = `0.6V - 0.4V = 1000`.
4. Solving for `V`: `0.2V = 1000`.
5. Total votes = `1000 / 0.2 = 5000`.

---

## **9. Area Change in a Rectangle**

### **Formula:**

Net % Change in Area = x + y + (xy / 100)

**Example:** If length increases by 40% and breadth by 30%, find the % change in area.

**Solution:**

1. Using formula: 40 + 30 + (40×30)/100.
2. \= 40 + 30 + 12 = **82% increase**.

---

## **10. Percentage Error**

### **Formula:**

Percentage Error = ((Actual Value - Incorrect Value) / Actual Value) × 100

**Example:** A number is multiplied by 100 instead of being divided by 100. Find % error.

**Solution:**

1. Correct result should be `X / 100`, but obtained result is `X × 100`.
2. Error = ((10000 - 1)/100) × 100.
3. \= **99.99% error**.

---

## **Example Set**

1. A price increases by 30% and then decreases by 20%. Find the net percentage change.

   - **Solution:** 30 - 20 + (30×-20)/100 = **4% increase**.

2. A’s salary is 40% more than B’s. How much percent is B’s salary less than A’s?

   - **Solution:** (40/140) × 100 = **28.57%**.

3. A sells a product at 18% profit. Find cost price if selling price is ₹236.

   - **Solution:** CP = 236 × 100 / 118 = **₹200**.

4. The population of a town grows by 10% annually. Find population after 4 years if current population is 5000.

   - **Solution:** 5000 × (1.1)^4 = **7320**.

5. A person saves 20% of his income. If his income increases by 25%, find the % increase in savings.

   - **Solution:** Savings increase by **50%**.

6. A student secured 42% marks in an exam and failed by 15 marks. The pass percentage is 45%. Find total marks.

   - **Solution:** Total marks = (15 / (45 - 42)) × 100 = **500**.

7. If the length of a rectangle is increased by 25% and breadth decreased by 20%, find % change in area.

   - **Solution:** 25 - 20 + (25 × -20)/100 = **0% (No change)**.
