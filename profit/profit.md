# Profit, Loss, and Discount

## Concept of Cost Price (C.P.) and Selling Price (S.P.)

- **Cost Price (C.P.):** The price at which an article is bought.
- **Selling Price (S.P.):** The price at which an article is sold.
- **Profit:** If S.P. > C.P., then Profit = S.P. - C.P.
- **Loss:** If C.P. > S.P., then Loss = C.P. - S.P.

### Formulas:

1. **Profit Percentage:** Profit % = (Profit / C.P.) × 100
2. **Loss Percentage:** Loss % = (Loss / C.P.) × 100
3. **Selling Price (S.P.):**
   - S.P. = C.P. × (1 + Profit % / 100)
   - S.P. = C.P. × (1 - Loss % / 100)
4. **Cost Price (C.P.):**
   - C.P. = S.P. / (1 + Profit % / 100)
   - C.P. = S.P. / (1 - Loss % / 100)

## Key Concepts and Examples

### 1. Profit & Loss Based on Percentage

- If a **75/4%** profit fetches Rs. 300, find C.P.:
  - 1% = 300 / (75/4) = 16, so 100% = 16 × 100 = Rs.1600
- If selling price is Rs. 450 and loss is **25%**, find the price for a **50% profit**:
  - 75% = 450, so 1% = 450 / 75, then 150% = 900

### 2. Equating Profit and Loss

- If profit at Rs. 1920 equals loss at Rs. 1280, find C.P. and S.P.:
  - C.P. = (1920 + 1280) / 2 = 1600
  - S.P. for 25% profit = 1600 × 1.25 = 2000

### 3. Profit/Loss from Selling Multiple Articles

- If **S.P. of 20 articles** = **C.P. of 25 articles**, find profit percentage:
  - C.P. / S.P. = 20 / 25 = 4/5, so Profit % = (1/4) × 100 = 25%

### 4. Dishonest Selling Practices

- If a shopkeeper **marks 50% above C.P.** and **gives a 10% discount** while also **cheating 20% in weight**, find overall profit:
  - C.P. = 100, M.R.P. = 150, S.P. after discount = 135
  - New C.P. = 80 (due to cheating in weight)
  - Profit % = ((135 - 80) / 80) × 100 = 68.75%

### 5. Successive Profit and Loss

- If an **item is bought at Rs. X** and sold at **Rs. Y** with a **15% profit**, and if X were **15% less** and Y **Rs. 52 less**, a **20% profit** would be earned.
- Using equations:
  - Y = 1.15X
  - (X - 0.15X) × 1.20 = Y - 52
  - Solving gives **X = Rs. 400**

### 6. Weight-Based Profits

- A **dishonest milkman** sells at C.P. but **adds water to earn 16.66% profit**:
  - x / (x + y) = 1 / 1.1666
  - **Ratio of mixture to milk** = **6:1**

- A **dishonest shopkeeper** sells using **900g instead of 1kg**:
  - Profit % = ((1000 - 900) / 900) × 100 = 11.11%

### 7. Finding Cost Price from Selling Price

- If an item is sold at **Rs. 144** and **profit % = C.P.**, find C.P.:
  - x + (x / 100) = 144
  - 1.01x = 144
  - x = 72

### 8. Successive Discounts

- Two successive discounts of **10% and 12.5%** are equivalent to a single discount:
  - 1 - (0.9 × 0.875)
  - 1 - 0.7875 = 21.25%

## Summary of Important Points

1. **Profit occurs when S.P. > C.P., and loss when S.P. < C.P.**
2. **Always consider cheating or weight manipulation in percentage calculations.**
3. **Successive discounts and profits must be calculated step by step, not added directly.**
4. **For dishonest practices, consider effective weight or price rather than marked ones.**
5. **For multiple item purchases and sales, break down into per-unit cost.**
6. **Formulas simplify solving for unknowns in profit-loss scenarios.**
