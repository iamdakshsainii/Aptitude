# Profit, Loss, and Discount

## Concept of Cost Price (C.P.) and Selling Price (S.P.)

- **Cost Price (C.P.):** The price at which an article is bought.
- **Selling Price (S.P.):** The price at which an article is sold.
- **Profit:** If \( S.P. > C.P. \), then \( \text{Profit} = S.P. - C.P. \)
- **Loss:** If \( C.P. > S.P. \), then \( \text{Loss} = C.P. - S.P. \)

### Formulas

1. **Profit Percentage:**
   \[
   \text{Profit \%} = \left( \frac{\text{Profit}}{\text{C.P.}} \right) \times 100
   \]

2. **Loss Percentage:**
   \[
   \text{Loss \%} = \left( \frac{\text{Loss}}{\text{C.P.}} \right) \times 100
   \]

3. **Selling Price (S.P.):**
   \[
   S.P. = C.P. \times \left( 1 + \frac{\text{Profit \%}}{100} \right)
   \]
   \[
   S.P. = C.P. \times \left( 1 - \frac{\text{Loss \%}}{100} \right)
   \]

4. **Cost Price (C.P.):**
   \[
   C.P. = \frac{S.P.}{\left( 1 + \frac{\text{Profit \%}}{100} \right)}
   \]
   \[
   C.P. = \frac{S.P.}{\left( 1 - \frac{\text{Loss \%}}{100} \right)}
   \]

## Key Concepts and Examples

### 1. Profit & Loss Based on Percentage

- If a **75/4%** profit fetches Rs. 300, find C.P.:
  \[
  1\% = \frac{300}{\frac{75}{4}} = 16, \quad 100\% = 16 \times 100 = Rs.1600
  \]

- If selling price is Rs. 450 and loss is **25%**, find the price for a **50% profit**:
  \[
  75\% = 450, \quad 1\% = \frac{450}{75}, \quad 150\% = 900
  \]

### 2. Equating Profit and Loss

- If profit at Rs. 1920 equals loss at Rs. 1280, find C.P. and S.P.:
  \[
  \text{C.P.} = \frac{1920 + 1280}{2} = 1600
  \]
  \[
  \text{S.P. for 25% profit} = 1600 \times 1.25 = 2000
  \]

### 3. Profit/Loss from Selling Multiple Articles

- If **S.P. of 20 articles** = **C.P. of 25 articles**, find profit percentage:
  \[
  \frac{C.P.}{S.P.} = \frac{20}{25} = \frac{4}{5}, \quad \text{Profit \%} = \left( \frac{1}{4} \times 100 \right) = 25\%
  \]

### 4. Dishonest Selling Practices

- If a shopkeeper **marks 50% above C.P.** and **gives a 10% discount** while also **cheating 20% in weight**, find overall profit:
  \[
  \text{C.P.} = 100, \quad \text{M.R.P.} = 150, \quad \text{S.P. after discount} = 135
  \]
  \[
  \text{New C.P.} = 80 \quad (\text{due to cheating in weight})
  \]
  \[
  \text{Profit \%} = \left( \frac{135 - 80}{80} \right) \times 100 = 68.75\%
  \]

### 5. Successive Profit and Loss

- If an **item is bought at Rs. X** and sold at **Rs. Y** with a **15% profit**, and if X were **15% less** and Y **Rs. 52 less**, a **20% profit** would be earned.
- Using equations:
  \[
  Y = 1.15X
  \]
  \[
  (X - 0.15X) \times 1.20 = Y - 52
  \]
  - Solving gives **X = Rs. 400**

### 6. Weight-Based Profits

- A **dishonest milkman** sells at C.P. but **adds water to earn 16.66% profit**:
  \[
  \frac{x}{x + y} = \frac{1}{1.1666}
  \]
  - **Ratio of mixture to milk** = **6:1**

- A **dishonest shopkeeper** sells using **900g instead of 1kg**:
  \[
  \text{Profit \%} = \left( \frac{1000 - 900}{900} \right) \times 100 = 11.11\%
  \]

### 7. Finding Cost Price from Selling Price

- If an item is sold at **Rs. 144** and **profit % = C.P.**, find C.P.:
  \[
  x + \frac{x}{100} = 144
  \]
  \[
  1.01x = 144
  \]
  \[
  x = 72
  \]

### 8. Successive Discounts

- Two successive discounts of **10% and 12.5%** are equivalent to a single discount:
  \[
  1 - (0.9 \times 0.875)
  \]
  \[
  1 - 0.7875 = 21.25\%
  \]

## Summary of Important Points

1. **Profit occurs when S.P. > C.P., and loss when S.P. < C.P.**
2. **Always consider cheating or weight manipulation in percentage calculations.**
3. **Successive discounts and profits must be calculated step by step, not added directly.**
4. **For dishonest practices, consider effective weight or price rather than marked ones.**
5. **For multiple item purchases and sales, break down into per-unit cost.**
6. **Formulas simplify solving for unknowns in profit-loss scenarios.**

These key concepts should help in solving profit-loss related problems efficiently.
