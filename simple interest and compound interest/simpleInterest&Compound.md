# Simple Interest (SI) and Compound Interest (CI)

## Basic Concepts

### Simple Interest (SI)
- **Definition:** Interest calculated only on the principal amount over a period.
- **Formula:**
  - SI = (P Ã— R Ã— T) / 100
- **Amount:**
  - A = P + SI
- **Where:**
  - P = Principal (Initial Amount)
  - R = Rate of Interest (per annum)
  - T = Time (in years)

### Compound Interest (CI)
- **Definition:** Interest is calculated on both the principal and previously accumulated interest.
- **Formula:**
  - CI = P Ã— (1 + R/100)^T - P
- **Amount:**
  - A = P Ã— (1 + R/100)^T
- **Where:**
  - P = Principal
  - R = Rate of Interest (per annum)
  - T = Time (in years)

## Key Differences Between SI and CI
- **For Two Years:**
  - CI - SI = P Ã— (R/100)^2
- **For Three Years:**
  - CI - SI = P Ã— (R/100)^2 Ã— (3 + R/100)
- **When SI and CI are equal:**
  - Interest is applied only once.
- **For small interest rates and short time periods:**
  - SI â‰ˆ CI.

## Special Cases
- **If compounded half-yearly:**
  - R â†’ R/2 and T â†’ 2T
- **If compounded quarterly:**
  - R â†’ R/4 and T â†’ 4T
- **Effective Rate of Interest:**
  - Re = (1 + R/N)^N - 1) Ã— 100, where N is the number of compounding periods.
- **Depreciation Formula:**
  - A = P Ã— (1 - R/100)^T

## Examples

### Example 1: Finding SI
**Problem:** What is the simple interest on â‚¹2000 at 3.5% per annum for 6 years?

**Solution:**
- Using the formula:
  - SI = (P Ã— R Ã— T) / 100
- Substituting values:
  - SI = (2000 Ã— 3.5 Ã— 6) / 100
- Calculation:
  - SI = â‚¹420

### Example 2: Finding CI
**Problem:** Find the compound interest on â‚¹8000 at 10% per annum for 2 years.

**Solution:**
- Using the formula:
  - CI = P Ã— (1 + R/100)^T - P
- Substituting values:
  - CI = 8000 Ã— (1 + 10/100)^2 - 8000
- Calculation:
  - CI = 8000 Ã— (1.1)^2 - 8000 = â‚¹1680

### Example 3: CI vs SI Difference
**Problem:** The difference between CI and SI for 2 years at 14.28% per annum is â‚¹30. Find the principal.

**Solution:**
- Using the formula:
  - P = (D Ã— 100Â²) / RÂ²
- Substituting values:
  - P = (30 Ã— 100Â²) / (14.28Â²)
- Calculation:
  - P â‰ˆ â‚¹1430

### Example 4: Finding Rate
**Problem:** If 2 years of SI is â‚¹200 and the difference between SI and CI is â‚¹7, find the rate.

**Solution:**
- Using the formula:
  - CI - SI = P Ã— (R/100)^2
- Substituting values and solving for R:
  - R â‰ˆ 7%

### Example 5: Loan Repayment
**Problem:** A person borrows â‚¹30000 at 10% SI for 2 years and pays back â‚¹36480. How much was borrowed at 12%?

**Solution:**
- Using the SI formula:
  - SI = (P Ã— R Ã— T) / 100
- Breaking into two parts and solving the system of equations:
  - We get â‚¹12000 at 12% and â‚¹18000 at 10%.

### Example 6: Doubling Money
**Problem:** If a sum doubles in 6 years, find the rate.

**Solution:**
- Using SI formula:
  - P = 2P, SI = P
- Rearranging:
  - R = (100 Ã— SI) / (P Ã— T)
- Substituting values:
  - R = (100 Ã— P) / (P Ã— 6)
- Calculation:
  - R = 16.66%

## Tips & Tricks
- **For quick CI calculations, use the formula:**
  - CI â‰ˆ SI + (SI Ã— R/100) for small values of R.
- **Use logarithms for solving large exponent CI problems efficiently.**
- **For investments, compare the effective annual interest rate rather than nominal rates.**
